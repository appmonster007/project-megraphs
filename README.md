## Notes

### Header Only Libraries
- Managing header and source files across versions can be pain, so we suggest the idea of using header only libraries
- herodotos.hpp is a simple logging utility which can be found in the include folder and can be used as a template to write more header only libraries
- Advantages of header only libraries, no need to worry about managing .hpp and .cc files separately, no complex build process, just include and remember to use the implementation, it's so simple!
